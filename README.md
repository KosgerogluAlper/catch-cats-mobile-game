# catch-cats-mobile-game
This is a mobile game, currently in the prototype stage, developed with Unity.<br/>  In this game, your goal is to place obstacles in the cats' path to capture them. Instead of using Unity's NavMesh system, the enemies in the game utilize a more performance-efficient artificial intelligence system that responds to conditions.
